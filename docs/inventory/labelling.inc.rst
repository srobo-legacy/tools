Labelling Assets
----------------

All assets that are entered into the inventory system must have their asset
code written on them. When first entering items into the inventory it is
possible to indicate that an asset does not yet have its code written on with
the labelled field however the code should be written on as soon as possible
and the inventory updated as appropriate. Only asset codes assigned to actually
assets should be written onto items, not asset codes assigned to assemblies. An
asset code assigned to an assembly is used as a unique identifier in the
inventory system and it does not make sense to write it onto any real-world
item.
