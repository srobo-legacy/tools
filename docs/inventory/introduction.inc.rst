Introduction

In true Student Robotics fashion, the inventory is a Git repository containing
YAML files tied together with Python scripts.

All items owned by Student Robotics, except those of very low-value, are
tracked in this system. The main purpose of this is to allow us to know what we
have, where it is and what condition it is in.

There is an :ref:`API <api.inventory>` for talking with the inventory from
Python and also an extensive :ref:`query language <inventory.queries>`.
